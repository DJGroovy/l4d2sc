	//	Configure according to your needs. If you leave this named configuration as it is, 
	//  then change the value of the "database" key to the database you want. 
	//  Remember that you must have a "players" table to save the points. If you do not have it, 
	//  the plugin will create it by default, otherwise check exist that the following fields:
	//		>> steamid - The player's steam id
	//		>> points - Points earned for gifts
	//		>> collected_gift - The total of gifts collected per player
	//		>> collected_gift_standard - The standard gifts collected by player
	//		>> collected_gift_special - Special gifts collected by player
	//	If some of these fields do not exist, create them manually.
